              Heyo ðŸ‘‹! I&apos;m{" "}
              <Link href="https://github.com/verzac">verzac</Link>, and I&apos;m
              currently the only official maintainer of this bot. The bot runs
              on my AWS server in Singapore, and no-one but the
              &quot;maintainers&quot; have access to the underlying
              infrastructure (including the aforementioned server) that powers
              the bot.

                GroceryBot processes your data given by you to the bot through
                its commands so that it can provide you with its intended
                services. Our policy is that NO HUMANS are allowed to manually
                look at GroceryBot&apos;s database, unless if you have
                specifically provided written consent (e.g. to debug an issue
                that you are having with the bot).
              </Typography>
              <Typography gutterBottom>
                It is also important to note that we do aggregate and collect
                anonymised usage data. For example, we record how long
                GroceryBot takes to serve up a request/command within a
                particular period on average. Rest assured though, these data
                are fully anonymous (i.e. from those data alone, no-one can
                figure out who people are and what they&apos;re using the bot
                for).

                GroceryBot processes the following data:

              <Typography gutterBottom>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your grocery entry (duh).</li>
                  <li>
                    Your server ID - this is used to indicate which grocery list
                    is for which server.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your Discord ID - this is a number-based ID from Discord
                    (e.g. 12345678), not your Discord username (e.g.
                    verzac#1234). This is used to power{" "}
                    <CommandText>!grodeets</CommandText> so that you can tell
                    who created what entry.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When your grocery entry is updated - removed items are
                    removed immediately and permanently.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your channel ID - this is used so that GroceryBot knows
                    where to send updates to (currently used by{" "}
                    <CommandText>!grohere</CommandText>).
