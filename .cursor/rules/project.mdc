This project (GroceryBot, also known as GroBot) is a Discord bot that tracks a user's grocery lists in a given Discord server.

Stack:

- Golang
- discordgo
- gorm
- SQLite
- echo v4

It also has a /docs subfolder which is a web app (Docusaurus) that is independent to the rest of the repo.

You can find the db migrations on `/db/changelog`.

All new repository methods should accept context (even if it's not directly using it) - leave the old repository methods be for backward-compatibility.
